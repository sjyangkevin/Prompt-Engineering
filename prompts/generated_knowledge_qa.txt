Input: Glasses always fog up.
Knowledge: Condensation occurs on eyeglass lenses when water vapor\u2014from your sweat, breath, and ambient humidity\u2014lands on a cold surface, cools, and then changes into tiny drops of liquid, forming a film that you see as fog. Your lenses will be relatively cool compared to your breath, especially when the outside air is cold.
