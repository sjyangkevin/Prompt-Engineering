prompt:
Find the value of x in the equation 3x - 9 = 27.
The value of x is 12.
Find the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15.
The value of x is 5.
Find the value of x in the equation 5x = 15.
The value of x is 3.
Find the value of x in the equation 8 + x = 10.
The value of x is 2.
Find the value of x in the equation 2x / 2 = 10.
The value of x is 10.
Find the value of x in the equation 8x - 8 = 8x / 2.

The value of x is 0.

prompt:
Find the value of x in the equation 2x / 2 = 10.
Multiply both sides by 2
the equation becomes 2x = 20.
Divide both sides by 2.
x = 10.
The value of x is 10.

Find the value of x in the equation 3x / 3 = 9 + 2x.
Multiply both sides by 3
the equation becomes 3x = 27 + 6x.
Subtract 3x from both sides
the equation becomes 0 = 27 + 3x.
Subtract 27 from both sides
the equation becomes -27 = 3x.
Divide 3 from both sides
the equation becomes -9 = x.
The value of x is -9.
Find the value of x in the equation 8x - 8 = 8x / 2.

Multiply both sides by 2
the equation becomes 16x - 16 = 8x.
Add 16 to both sides
the equation becomes 16x = 8x + 16.
Subtract 8x from both sides
the equation becomes 8x = 16.
Divide both sides by 8
the equation becomes x = 2.
The value of x is 2.

prompt:
Find the value of x in the equation 8x - 8 = 8x / 2. Let's think step by step.
8x - 8 = 8x / 2
Multiply both sides by 2:
16x - 16 = 8x
Subtract 8x from both sides:
8x - 16 = 0
Add 16 to both sides:
8x = 16
Divide both sides by 8:
x = 2.

The final answer: 2.
